All significant learning is composed of brief spurts of progress followed by long periods of work where if feels as if you are stuck on a plateau.\u00a0There are no experts\u2013only learners."

The most dependable way to outperform the market is to buy something for less than its value.

Many people mistakenly believe nurture only refers to how parents raise their children. Although children do learn things from their parents, they learn far more from their peers. The world that children share with their peer group is what shapes their behavior, modifies the characteristics they were born with, and determines the sort of people they will be when they grow up."

He lived a full life that included dealing with criticism over being gay, attending medical school at Oxford University, experimenting with heavy drug use, traveling the United States and Canada by motorcycle, suffering life-threatening injuries, squatting a California state record of 600 pounds, and being honored by the Queen of England for his many books and storied career as a physician.

Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future: live immediately.\u00a0In any situation in life you will find delights and relaxations and pleasures if you are prepared to make light of your troubles and not let them distress you."

As a result, many people already have good intentions, but don\u2019t follow through due to forgetfulness, procrastination, or a general lack of awareness. We can bridge the gap between our intentions and our behavior by using strategies to lock in our future behavior like active choice, pre-commitment, good design, reframing, and simplicity."

The way autistic people view the world is very different than the way we may perceive them to view the world. This disconnect between how we view and treat people with autism and how they actually view the world makes living with autism even more difficult."
